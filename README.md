Building a Roguelike in Bevy

# What is this?
The goal of this project is three-fold:
* Get better at Rust through practical application
* Learn more about game design by building a Rust-like
* Learn more about the Bevy engine

As this project is a 'learning' experience, it's far from optimal. The end goal will be implementing
a comparable Rust and Bevy-centric port of the canonical roguelike-dev tutorial (originally written
for python using the libtcod library - found here: http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

# Resources used
Alongside the python libtcod tutorial above, additional rust and bevy resources were used:
* The Bevy "Getting Started" guide: https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/
* A Roguelike Tutorial in Rust + tcod: https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html
* The Roguelike Dev subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/
